# Large-scale-face-clustering
Seminar project which build up a pipeline combining vgg19 and clutering algorithm trained on the bottleneck features
train_net.py  extracted training data and preprocesing and train the vgg19
generate_test.py generate testing dataset with difference imbalance ratio
find_cluster.py find the biggest cluster regarding as the main character in the dataset
calculate_score.py  evaluation for precision recall and F measure
